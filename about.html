There is no ‚ÄúYoyogi server‚Äù: rather your browser talks to your Fediverse server‚Äîand I never see any of your data. But you do have to get your Fediverse server to talk to your browser, so there‚Äôs still the concept of logging in:</p><ol><li>Type in the URL of your server, e.g.,<!-- --> <code>https://octodon.social</code> and click ‚ÄúSubmit‚Äù.</li><li>Yoyogi sends you to that server, which after ascertaining you‚Äôre logged in, will ask you, ‚ÄúHey, this Yoyogi thing wants to have permission to read what you can read (no writing/changing), that ok?‚Äù</li><li>Assuming you trust me, you say ‚ÄúAuthorize‚Äù.</li><li>Mastodon sends you back to Yoyogi and you can get started!</li></ol><p></p></section><section><h2 id="anticipated-questions" class="about_slugged__k7ViN">Anticipated questions<!-- --> <a href="/about#anticipated-questions">#</a></h2><p><strong>Why does it look so terrible?</strong> Yoyogi is just barely in the MVP (minimum viable product) stage. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs<!-- --> <a href="https://blog.asmartbear.com/slc.html">SLC</a> (simple, lovable, complete) yet.</p><p><strong>Why is it so slow?</strong> Largely due to my not hiding network latency better‚Äîwe could definitely be showing you toots and threads faster, and showing a spinner when we have nothing. But in some way, this usage pattern is not well-supported by the Mastodon server API at least, which expects you to read a few toots at a time<!-- --> <em>in temporal order</em>, rather than whole threads at a time. What Yoyogi does is, it takes a chunk of temporally-contiguous toots (one network call) and builds the thread around each (one network call <em>per</em> toot), dramatically increasing the work done. There are various technical solutions to this (caching, smarter database/API layer), which is partly why I haven‚Äôt even tried reaching for the low-hanging fruit (that‚Äôs a lie, mostly it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm lazy).</p><p>Also note that we‚Äôre not saving any toots locally in your browser yet. That would make it much faster when you keep up with an author regularly (not much to fetch from the server), but wouldn‚Äôt help much if you‚Äôre at all like me and sometimes days go by without checking in with some folks.</p><p><strong>Why is it lacking &lt;important feature&gt;?</strong> See above.</p><p><strong>What features are next?</strong> Great question.</p><ol><li>My mental image for Yoyogi is frankly Google Reader. I‚Äôd love it if it kept track of how many unread toots I have from each of my follows. Or at least how many days it‚Äôs been since I caught up.</li></ol><p><strong>Will it ever have a mode to <em>write</em> posts?</strong> <!-- -->No I don‚Äôt think so. Posting for me is a totally different mental activity than reading/catching up. It‚Äôs in fact <em>two</em> mental activities:</p><ol><li>quick conversations‚Äîthe timeline is actually great for this, so I‚Äôd switch back to a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù Mastodon or Misskey or Pleroma or Pinafore app; and</li><li>Zen-mode composing toots and threads. This I often do in a proper document writing app (my journaling app, a notes app, etc.).</li></ol></section></main></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/about","query":{},"buildId":"Wn4ZW11nSEbj3EqjIZSsH","assetPrefix":"/yoyogi","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
